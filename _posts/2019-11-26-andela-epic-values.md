# My reflections on Andela's EPIC values

In this post, I try to explain what I understand by the EPIC values at Andela. I believe that if someone can apply these values to their daily life _(not just in professional life, but also in personal life)_, they will be able to achieve success in even the biggest goals they set for themselves.

## Excellence

> With this life approach, I aspire to be the best possible version of myself. I know that my work is a representation of who I am, and I hold everything I do and everyone I interact with to the highest standards. I am a lifelong learner who strives for mastery of my craft.

In my view, excellence is a daily commitment. It means using every day to make yourself better.  

## Passion

> With this life approach, I believe I can change the world and I act accordingly. I constantly seek to inspire and to be inspired. I approach every goal with unwavering energy and conviction; I embody grit and persistence.

## Integrity

> With this life approach, I live in accordance with my values. I know that all I do is a reflection of the values I profess. I embrace the added responsibility of leading by example, and want others to hold me accountable. I know Integrity is everything I say and everything I do which is a true reflections of what I value and what is important to me.

## Collaboration

> With this life approach, I will be able to have a greater impact by joining forces with others. I will know how to effectively collaborate with individuals from different backgrounds, with different beliefs and personalities, in order to achieve our goals.
