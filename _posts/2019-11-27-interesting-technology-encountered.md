# Pivotal Tracker

In my preparation for the Andela Bootcamp, I was introduced to many interesting tools and technologies. I got to learn about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a Javascript runtime, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - a web framework for Node.js, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - a Node.js package for fixing problems in your Javascript code, and one of my favourites... [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) - a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. But none of these technologies fascinated me as much as [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) - a tool for Agile Project Management.
